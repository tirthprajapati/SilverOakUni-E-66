                    The hare is an animal that is known to move quickly, while a tortoise is one to move slowly.
                    One day, the hare challenged the tortoise to a race simply to prove that he was the best. The tortoise agreed.
                    Once the race began the hare was easily able to get a head start. Upon realizing that the tortoise is far behind. The overconfident hare decided to take a nap.
                    Meanwhile the tortoise, who was extremely determined and dedicated to the race was slowly nearing the finish line.
                    The tortoise won the race while the hare napped. Most importantly he did it with humility and without arrogance.            </p>

                    While the boy watched over the sheep, he got bored and decided to have some fun.
                    So, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf!”. Upon hearing this the villagers ran to help him chase the Wolf away.
                    As they reached him, they realized that there was no Wolf and he was just kidding. The villagers were furious and they yelled at the boy for creating chaos and panic.
                    On the next day and the boy shouted “Wolf!” again and once again the villagers came to help him and saw that there was no wolf. This made them very angry again.

                    The ant and the grasshopper were best friends with very different personalities.
                    The grasshopper would spend his days sleeping or playing his guitar while the ant would collect food and build his ant hill. 
                    Every now and then, the grasshopper would tell the ant to take a break. However, the ant would refuse and continue to complete his work.
                    Soon winter came making the days and nights cold. One day the colony of ants were busy trying to dry some grains of corn. The grasshopper who was extremely weak and hungry came up to the ants and asked "Can you please give me a piece of corn?" the ant replied "We worked hard for this corn all summer while you relaxed, why should we give it to you?"
                    The grasshopper was so busy singing and sleeping  that he didn't have enough food to last winter. The grasshopper realized his mistake.
